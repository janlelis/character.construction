# Blank Characters

<div class="intro">
  There are a lot of white-space character in Unicode. Sometimes, such blank codepoints have a totally different meaning, but as a side-effect, they also do not contain any glyph. 
  The following list collects characters which might render no glyph. The exact behavior depends on the platform/operating system.

  
  Also see [Ignorables](/ignorables) for the current list of codepoints in Unicode marked as <a href="https://idiosyncratic-ruby.com/66-ruby-has-character.html#ignorable-codepoints">default ignorable codepoints</a>, which often do not render anything.
