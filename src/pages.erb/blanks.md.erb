# Blank Characters

<div class="intro">
  There are a bunch of white-space character in Unicode. Sometimes, such blank codepoints have a totally different meaning, but as a side-effect, they also do not contain any glyph.

  The following list collects characters which might render no glyph. The exact behavior depends on the platform/operating system.

  Please also note, some codepoints in Unicode are marked as <a href="https://idiosyncratic-ruby.com/66-ruby-has-character.html#ignorable-codepoints">ignorable</a> and often do not render <em>anything</em>, not even a space.
