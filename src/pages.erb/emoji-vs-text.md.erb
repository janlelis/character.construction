# Emoji vs. Text Presentation

<div class="intro">
  Some Emoji can be toggled between a textual and pictographic (emoji) display. This is done by appending a specific codepoint to the Emoji, a so called variation selector. There are two Emoji-relevant variation selectors:

  <br/><br/>

  <ul>
    <li>U+FE0E (Variation Selector 15): Prefer text</li>
    <li>U+FE0F (Variation Selector 16): Prefer picture</li>
  </ul>

  Still, it depends on your platform/operating system how these Emoji are presented. For example, on macOS, a textual smiley might nevertheless be shown as a colorful Emoji smiley.

  The list contains all text and pictographic representations of switching-enabled Emoji. The middle column shows the default display without any variation selector.
</div>

<%= emoji_text_name %>
